Tip: Here are six learning strategies that can help you learn how to learn more effectively - RIVERS is the acronym.
 
RETRIEVAL
Repeatedly retrieving concepts from memory is one of the best ways to learn them. We may think that simple rereading works, but it can be more effective to:
 
- Rephrase learnings in your own words and practice recall
- Convert salient points into series of questions then answer them
- Relate to something outside the subject that helps you remember
 
Repeated retrieval can embed knowledge pretty deep so that it becomes reflexive.
 
~ "Rereading is time consuming and doesn’t result in durable memory. And it often involves a kind of unwitting self-deception, as growing familiarity with the text comes to feel like mastery of the content. One of the best habits a learner can instill is regular self quizzing to calibrate understanding of what you do and do not know"
 
INTERLEAVING
Switching between related learning tasks in a single session can help solidify learning.
 
We may think that mass practice can feel more productive. While it can help with retention in the short term, long term durable learning is greatly helped by interleaving related topics together. This can also help build your skills to look at problems and appreciate which principles you need to pull from your experience.
 
VARIED PRACTICE
Practicing the same skill in different contexts, and at varying levels of difficulty, can enhance learning. 
 
ELABORATION
If you want to learn something in depth, try explaining and describing ideas with many details and multiple examples. It can really help here to take complex topics you’re learning and distill them into analogies, components or principles if this helps you absorb them more easily. 
 
REFLECTION
Reflecting on new learning and questioning what you think are how you build new knowledge. You can ask yourself semi-regularly:
 
- What did you learn?
- Did you form opinions on what you learned?
- How comfortable are you explaining it to others?
- How are you applying it or thinking about applying it?
- What are gaps that you might want to re-study?
- Are there other areas of your life you can apply the learning to?
 
SPACED REPETITION
When you learn a new concept or fact, make sure to revisit it every once in a while to make sure that it sticks in your memory. This kind of practice is most effective when it is spaced out (leaving time between practice sessions) and interleaved with other kinds of learning of subjects.
 
"To be most effective, retrieval must be repeated again and again, in spaced out sessions so that the recall requires some cognitive effort. Repeated recall appears to help memory consolidate into a cohesive representation in the brain and to strengthen and multiply the neural routes by which the knowledge can later be retrieved"
