Well-Architected Module 3

SECURITY
the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
(identity and access management, detection, infrastructure protection, data protection, incident response)

SECURITY DESIGN PRINCIPLES
-implement a strong identity foundation
-use fine-grained access controls
-apply security at all layers
-automate security best practice
-prepare for security events and automation

SECURELY OPERATE
security operations in the cloud: AWS accounts, AWS organizations, AWS control tower

IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT: IDENTITIES
managing human and machine identities
-AWS identity and access management (IAM)
-strong sign-in mechanisms
-centralized identity provider
-secure secrets

IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT: PERMISSION
manage permissions for human and machine identities
-define access requirements
-grant least priveleges
-limit public and cross-account access
-reduce permission continuosly

IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT: AMAZON COGNITO
-support multiple login providers
-unique users/devices
-helps implement security best practice

SECURITY: DETECTIVE CONTROLS
use detective controls to detect or identify a security event
-lifecycle controls to establish operational baselines
-internal auditing to examine controls
-automated alerting

DETECTION: AUTOMATING MISCONFIGURATION DETECTION AND RESPONSE
aws provides a way to record resource configuration changes as they occur, and evaluate them againts rules you configure by using the aws config service.
with conformance packs for AWS config, you confgure rules coupled with automated remediation. this enables you to automate response to misconfigurations.

SECURITY: INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION
infrastructure protection encompasses control methodologies necessary to meet best practices and industry or regulatory obligations.
-trust boundaries
-operating system
-system security configuration
-policy enforcement points

INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION: CONTROL TRAFFIC AT ALL LAYERS
layers in your architecture allow you to apply a defense in-depth approach to securing your networks.
-use edge services (ex. amazon cloudfront with AWS WAF)
-devide amazon virtual private cloud (amazon VPC) into layers using subnets
-use all controls available

INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION: USE MANAGED SERVICES
use AWS managed services that reduce maintenance tasks:
-managed service takes care of underlying instances or compute and therefore patching and hardening
-customers can focus on securing their workload

SECURITY: DATA PROTECTION
data protection involves identifying and classifying the data you have, and then using controls and patterns to keep your data confidential while preserving its integrity and availability at rest and in transit.
(data classification, keep people away from data, protection in transit)

DATA PROTECTION: KEEP PEOPLE AWAY FROM DATA
a security best practice for data protection is to use mechanisms to keep people away from data.
-use continuous integration (CI) or Continuous deployment (CD)
-determine which controls and processes are required

SECURITY: INCIDENT RESPONSE
incident response defines how the processes need to be in place to respond to and mitigate the potential impact of security incidents.
(easy way to gain access, right-predeployed tools, conduct game days regulary)

INCIDENT RESPONSE: TEMPLATED 'CLEAN ROOMS'
create a new, trusted environment to conduct your investigations.
	1.create or use an existing template
	2.save locally or in amazon s3 bucket
	3.use AWS cloudformation to create a stack based on your template. it constructs and configures your stack resources
