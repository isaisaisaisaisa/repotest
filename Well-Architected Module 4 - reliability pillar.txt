Well-Architected Module 4 - reliability pillar

RELIABLITY PILLAR
reliability is the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to.
this include the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. to achieve reliability, we focus on resiliency.
-recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
-dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
-mitigate disruptions

the reliability pillar focusses on the ability to recover from failures and meet demand in the following areas:
-foundations
-workkload architecture
-change management
-failure management

RELIABILITY DESIGN PRINCIPLES
reliability in a traditional environment:
-manually recover from failure
-rarely test recovery procedures
-multipke single points of failure
-need to guess capacity

RELIABILITY IN THE CLOUD ENVIRONMENT:
-automatically recover from failure
-test recovery procedures
-scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
-stop guessing capacity
-manage change in automation

FOUNDATIONS: NETWORK TOPOLOGY
foundational requirements are those whose scope extends beyond a single workload or project. before architecting any system, foundational requirements that influence reliability should be in place.
(you must have sufficient network bandwith to your data center)

FOUNDATIONS: SERVICE QUOTAS AND CONSTRAINTS
understanding physical limits and resource constraints
(service limits: Service Quotas and Fixed Limits)

WORKLOAD ARCHITECTURE: DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
-design your workload service architecture
-service oriented architecture or microservices
-architecture design to prevent failures
-architecture design to mitigate failures

CHANGE MANAGEMENT: MONITOR WORKLOAD
-monitor behavior
-amazon simple notification service (SNS)
-review
-amazon cloudwatch

CHANGE MANAGEMENT DEPLOYMENT
-use runbooks
-integrate testing as part of deployment
-use immutable infrastructure

FAILURE MANAGEMENT: WITHSTAND COMPONENT FAILURES
